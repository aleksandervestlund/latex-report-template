\section{Introduction}

This template is a work in progress and will likely be updated in the future. That said, it currently provides a solid foundation for most types of documents and should be suitable for a wide range of use cases. This is meant to be too large a collection, where almost no documents will use all packages. The target is to never have to add code \--- just remove it. This template is meant to have full support for American, British, and Norwegian.

If you notice that certain packages are included in \texttt{packages.sty} are not being used, it may be beneficial to comment them out or remove them. This can help reduce compile time and avoid unnecessary package conflicts.

The subsequent sections are written with help from \gls{ai} to demonstrate the packages.
